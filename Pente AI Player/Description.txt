In this version of Pente. You capture pieces by placing a piece so that it brackets a pair of the opponent's pieces between two of yours, either
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each captured piece is removed from the board, leaving its former position empty. That position can be played 
on again freely by either player. It is possible to capture more than one pair on a single turn by bracketing multiple pairs. 
A player can win the game by capturing 10 opponents stones or having 5 stones in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
This program also supports tic-tac-toe.

To play, open main.java under "AI player."
The main program expects three main program arguments:
<game> <player1> <player2>
The game argument is either “tic-tac-toe” or “pente." The player1 and player2 arguments are either "human",“ai” or “ai2”, where
player “ai2” is a updated version of "ai" becasue it uses the transposition table (hash table). For example, running the
game with arguments “pente human ai” will start a game where player 1 is human and
player 2 is a computer player; running it as “pente ai ai2” will start up two computer players
against each other.

Here are the optional arguments before the game argument:
-- help 
Print a usage message and quit
-- showinfo 
Print out verbose statistics while AI players run
-- timelimit <ms> 
Specify the maximum time for an AI player to make its move
(overriding the default, 3000 ms)
For example, you can enter "-- showinfo pente ai2 human" and the heuristic of AI player will be printed.
